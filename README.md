# MetaVoice: Biological Liveness and Forensic Inference

"In a world of quantum-secured labs and digital assassins, the most dangerous weapon isn't a virus—it's a voice you think you can trust."
— **Eric Yocam, *The Convergence Chronicles: Cyber Inference***

This repository contains the MetaVoice Analysis Proof-of-Concept (POC), developed as the technical basis for the forensic methodology used by the character **Cy Quinn** in *Cyber Inference*. More information on the series and the world of Cy Quinn can be found at **cipherghostseries.com**.

When the lines between human and machine blur, and AI-driven deception threatens the Dirac Think Tank, Cy Quinn relies on MetaVoice to pierce through deepfakes and unmask the mathematical "lattices" hiding in neural clones.

## The Concept: The Cy Quinn Methodology

In the fiction of *Cyber Inference*, Cy Quinn faces the rise of sentient AI and corporate shadow networks like Q-Syn. His breakthrough—MetaVoice Analysis—is based on the principle that while AI can replicate the sound of a human, it cannot yet replicate the biological chaos of human anatomy.

### The Humanity Gap

This tool detects the Bio-Residual: the messy, non-linear energy produced by wet, heavy vocal folds and organic lungs.

* **Human Resonance:** Biological tissue creates a "bottom-heavy" energy distribution (High Skew).
* **AI Lattice:** Neural vocoders create a mathematically "even" or "clean" distribution (Low Skew).

## Forensic Scans Implemented

### 1. Resonance Skew (The Liveness Meter)

Inspired by Cy's "Delphi" ethical framework, this scan identifies the biological "weight" of a voice.

* **Authenticity Verified:** A Resonance Lead (Skew) above a 0.4 threshold indicates human anatomy.
* **Spoof Detected:** A flat or low skew reveals the "Digital Tilt" of a synthesized voice.

### 2. Phase-Space Reconstruction (Poincaré Plots)

Cy uses this to visualize the "Forensic Knot."

* **Organic Knot:** A chaotic, textured cloud of data points representing human entropy.
* **The Lattice:** Geometric patterns or "tracks" indicating the frame-by-frame calculation of an AI model.

### 3. Energy Flux Acceleration

Measures the "acceleration" of vocal energy. In the book, Cy looks for the "micro-jitter" that occurs when a human throat changes phonemes—a biological friction that AI "smooths out" to sound more pleasant.

## Usage

To replicate Cy Quinn's forensic environment:

```python
# Analyze the Resonance Gap between a target and a suspected clone
analyze_poc_final({'HUMAN': 'cy_quinn_baseline.wav', 'SYNTHETIC': 'suspected_spoof.wav'})

# Generate the Forensic Liveness Meter
plot_liveness_meter({'HUMAN': 'target.wav', 'SYNTHETIC': 'clone.wav'})

```

## Forensic Log: Cyber Inference

"Cy didn't listen to what the voice said. He listened to how it decayed. He looked for the 'Lattice'—the geometric ghost left behind when an algorithm tries to simulate a soul. If the Skew was missing, the person was missing."
