# MetaVoice: Biological Liveness and Forensic Inference

"In a world of quantum-secured labs and digital assassins, the most dangerous weapon isn't a virus—it's a voice you think you can trust."
— **Eric Yocam, *The Convergence Chronicles: Cyber Inference***

This repository contains the MetaVoice Analysis Proof-of-Concept (POC), developed as the technical basis for the forensic methodology used by the character **Cy Quinn** in *Cyber Inference*. More information on the series and the world of Cy Quinn can be found at **[cipherghostseries.com](https://cipherghostseries.com)**.

When the lines between human and machine blur, and AI-driven deception threatens the Dirac Think Tank, Cy Quinn relies on MetaVoice to pierce through deepfakes and unmask the mathematical "lattices" hiding in neural clones.

## The Concept: The Cy Quinn Methodology

In the fiction of *Cyber Inference*, Cy Quinn faces the rise of sentient AI and corporate shadow networks like Q-Syn. His breakthrough—MetaVoice Analysis—is based on the principle that while AI can replicate the sound of a human, it cannot yet replicate the **Nonlinear Phenomena (NLP)** inherent to biological anatomy.

### The Humanity Gap

This tool detects the **Bio-Residual**: the messy, non-linear energy produced by wet, heavy vocal folds and organic lungs.

* **Human Resonance:** Biological tissue creates chaotic, non-linear oscillators. This results in a "bottom-heavy" energy distribution (High Skew).
* **AI Lattice:** Neural vocoders rely on frame-based parametric synthesis, creating a mathematically "even" or "clean" distribution (Low Skew).

## Forensic Scans Implemented

### 1. Resonance Skew (The Liveness Meter)

Inspired by Cy's "Delphi" ethical framework, this scan identifies the biological "weight" of a voice using Higher-Order Statistics (HOS) to compare energy distributions.

* **Authenticity Verified:** As shown in the **MetaVoice Liveness Meter**, a Resonance Lead (Skew) above the threshold indicates human anatomy. 
* **The Verdict:** In this POC, the human subject achieved a skew of **1.6164** compared to the synthetic **1.1895**, resulting in a verified authenticity status.

### 2. Phase-Space Reconstruction (The Forensic Knot)

Cy uses this to visualize the signal by plotting samples against their own delays ($y[n]$ vs $y[n+1]$).

* **Organic Knot:** A chaotic, textured cloud of data points (Strange Attractor) representing human entropy.
* **The Lattice:** AI models often reveal geometric patterns or "tracks" indicating the periodic, frame-by-frame calculation of the algorithm.

## Technical Foundations

The methodology reflects seminal research on Nonlinear Phenomena (NLP) in voice production:

* **Vocal Chaos Theory:** Herzel, H., et al. "Nonlinear dynamics of the voice." *Chaos*, 1995. DOI: [10.1063/1.166078](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.166078)
* **NLP Analysis:** Anikin, A., & Herbst, C. T. "How to analyse and manipulate nonlinear phenomena in voice recordings." *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B*, 2025. DOI: [10.1098/rstb.2024.0003](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2024.0003)

## Usage

To replicate Cy Quinn's forensic environment:

```python
# Analyze the Resonance Gap between a target and a suspected clone
analyze_poc_final({'HUMAN': 'cy_quinn_baseline.wav', 'SYNTHETIC': 'suspected_spoof.wav'})

# Generate the Forensic Liveness Meter and Phase-Space Maps
plot_liveness_meter({'HUMAN': 'target.wav', 'SYNTHETIC': 'clone.wav'})

```

## Forensic Log: Cyber Inference

"Cy didn't listen to what the voice said. He listened to how it decayed. He looked for the 'Lattice'—the geometric ghost left behind when an algorithm tries to simulate a soul. If the Skew was missing, the person was missing."
